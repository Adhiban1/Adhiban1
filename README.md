## About Me

I finished my B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from Arunai Engineering College, Thiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu. In college, I worked on a project called Robotic-Arm-IOT. In this project, I learned how to program a microcontroller (ESP32) using both Python and C++. Although I intended to implement object detection for identifying and manipulating objects using Machine Learning & Deep Learning, I didn't have enough time back then to learn those aspects. So, I completed the project without object detection. However, I did manage to create a Python app that could automate the robotic arm to pick and drop objects in a loop.

Following that project, my interest grew in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). I've always had a keen interest in Mathematics and have even come up with various formulas during my school days. While many of those formulas already exist, I noticed that Data Science combines both mathematics and computer science. This realization prompted me to pursue a 12-month Data Science course. I not only followed the curriculum but also dedicated extra time every day to learn more about Data Science on my own. I found the subject fascinating and continued to expand my knowledge.

After completing the Data Science course, I undertook a Machine Learning Internship at Feynn Labs. Simultaneously, I am actively searching for job opportunities. I've found that securing a Data Science or Data Analysis job as a fresher can be quite challenging. To increase my prospects, I'm also learning backend development using Django. Additionally, I'm a fan of Linux and during the 12-month course, my laptop began running slow, so I decided to switch to Linux (Ubuntu). Now, I'm proficient in Linux, particularly Ubuntu and Arch.
